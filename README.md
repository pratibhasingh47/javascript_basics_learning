# This is my Javascript learning path üöÄ
I have learnt many concepts and fundamentals of javascript starting from javascript variable, datatypes, strings, for loops, while loops, for each loops, functions, arrow-functions and learing class and object concept. Also I have learnt about DOM manipulation techniques which is used to develope interactive webpages.I deeply understand the promises and hellback,promise-chaining & async-await functions also expanding my knowledge with using free API's.

You can take a idea of how javascript concept works in real life. If you want to explore more you can take a look of my other javascript_project repositorites like tic-tac-toe,etc ,these mini-project can help you to understand practical implementation of javascript.‚úåÔ∏è
